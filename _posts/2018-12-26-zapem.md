**codename**: zapem
(Dic 2018 â†’ Nov 2019)
We develop the administrative management system of the company that streamlines its marketing processes, inventory control and service provision in its wide variety of clients.

The custom-developed web application was built in different incremental stages allowing the client to quickly start organizing their information and making use of the tool.

My participation was mainly in the design process with the client. I defined the initial data model and collaborated with some ideas for the GUI but another developer was who coded the whole app.
